#  Once we have an environment, we can distinguish things according to the PLATFORM which is one of posix,
#  darwin, sunos, cygwin, win32 for the machines tested to date.  This does not distinguish the same OS on
#  different architectures where this is an issue.  For Python this is not an issue, but we are compiling C
#  so it is.  We therefore use uname to provide better discrimination.  This will give Linux, SunOS, Darwin,
#  CYGWIN_NT-5.[12], Windows as possible values for the operating system (no different from PLATFORM
#  really), and values like i686 for the processor where it can be determined, i.e. not on Windows but on all
#  other systems.  Combine this with the compiler in use and we have a complete platform specification so
#  that we can have multiple concurrent builds for different architectures all in the same source hierarchy.

#  We need to make use of the users' environment, especially PATH, when initializing the tools, so as to
#  ensure all the commands we are going to use are available.  In particular an issue arises usign SWIG on
#  Windows, the swig.exe executable is never in one of the standard places.  So always pick up the user PATH
